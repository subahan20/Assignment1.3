        <summary>Mangal Pandey</summary>
        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            Mangal Pandey was an Indian soldier who played a key role in the events taking place just before the
            outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. He was a sepoy (infantryman) in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry
            (BNI) regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984, the Indian government issued a postage stamp to
            remember him. His life and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic productions

        <h4>Mutiny</h4>
        <p>
            On the afternoon of 29 March 1857, Lieutenant Baugh, Adjutant of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, then
            stationed at Barrackpore was informed that several men of his regiment were in an excited state. Further, it
            was reported to him that one of them, Mangal Pandey, was pacing in front of the regiment's guard room by the
            parade ground, armed with a loaded musket, calling upon the men to rebel and threatening to shoot the first
            European that he set eyes on. Testimony at a subsequent enquiry recorded that Pandey, unsettled by unrest
            amongst the sepoys and intoxicated by the narcotic bhang, had seized his weapons and ran to the
            quarter-guard building upon learning that a detachment of British soldiers was disembarking from a steamer
            near the cantonment

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            Jawaharlal Nehru
            juh-WAH-hurr-LAHL NE-hǝ-ROO; 14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964 was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist,
            statesman, secular humanist, social democrat,[2] and author who was a central figure in India during the
            middle of the 20th century. Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and
            1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's first prime minister for 16 years.[3]
            Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully
            influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two
            blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as Letters from a Father to
            His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read around the
            world.
